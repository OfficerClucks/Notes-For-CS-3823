# Chapter 0 Notes

A **set** is a collection of distinct elements.
 - Elements can be anything (numbers, symbols, strings, etc.).
 - Example: A = {7, 21, 57}

The **elements** of a set are also called **members** of the set;
- e.g., 7 ∈ {7, 21, 57}, 8 /∈ {7, 21, 57}

A ⊆ B: Denotes “A is a **subset** of B”

A ( B: Denotes “A is a **proper subset** of B”

The order and repetitions of the elements do *not* matter;
- e.g., {57, 7, 7, 7, 21} = {7, 21, 57}.

If we take the occurrences of members into account, we have a ***multiset***;
then {57, 7, 7, 7, 21} ≠ {7, 21, 57}.

Infinite sets: Sets with **infinite** elements;
- e.g., N = {1, 2, 3, . . .}, Z = {. . . , −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, . . .}

Empty set: ∅
